# 3D Solar System Visualization

A web-based 3D visualization of our solar system using Three.js. This project creates an interactive 3D model of the solar system where you can explore the planets and their orbits.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Three.js (3D graphics library)
- CSS3 (for styling)

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and Three.js
- A local development server (can use Live Server extension in VS Code)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Solar System Setup
- Create a basic 3D scene with a sun at the center
- Add Earth and Moon with basic textures
- Implement basic camera controls for navigation
- Add simple lighting to illuminate the scene

### Milestone 2: Complete Solar System
- Add all planets with accurate relative sizes
- Implement orbital paths for each planet
- Add realistic textures for all celestial bodies
- Implement planet rotation and revolution speeds
- Add basic information display when hovering over planets

### Milestone 3: Enhanced Features
- Add realistic lighting effects (sun glow, planet shadows)
- Implement smooth camera transitions between planets
- Add interactive controls for time speed
- Include detailed information panels for each celestial body
- Add optional features like asteroid belt and dwarf planets
